# Traders Dynamic Index

Traders Dynamic Index (TDI) is a custom MT4/MT5/cTrader indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is adapted from the earlier version by Dean Malone. Traders Dynamic Index uses RSI and MA calculations to display the current market situation from multiple points of view.

The indicator supports all sorts of alerts, including arrows in the main window of the chart when one of the signals appears. It is also capable of displaying higher timeframe values on a lower timeframe chart.
